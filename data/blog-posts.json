    "content": "<p data-path-to-node=\"1\">When you think of a website, your brain might automatically add a <b data-path-to-node=\"1\" data-index-in-node=\"66\">.com</b> at the end. It’s the original and most common type of internet address. Whether you're running a small business in Eldoret, starting a tech company in Lagos, or running a consulting firm in Johannesburg, a <b data-path-to-node=\"1\" data-index-in-node=\"277\">.com</b> domain acts like a worldwide business card. It shows the world that you're ready to do business—not just in your local area, but around the globe.</p><p data-path-to-node=\"1\"><br></p><p data-path-to-node=\"2\">But let's be honest: registering a domain can feel like a pain if you're working with international providers who don't get how we run our business. That’s where <b data-path-to-node=\"2\" data-index-in-node=\"162\">Truehost</b> comes in. Here's the real scoop on why you need a <b data-path-to-node=\"2\" data-index-in-node=\"221\">.com</b>, how to get it with the payment methods you're comfortable using, and how to steer clear of those frustrating tech problems.</p><p data-path-to-node=\"3\"><b data-path-to-node=\"3\" data-index-in-node=\"0\">In this guide, you’ll learn:</b></p><ul data-path-to-node=\"4\"><li><p data-path-to-node=\"4,0,0\">Why <b data-path-to-node=\"4,0,0\" data-index-in-node=\"4\">.com</b> still dominates globally</p></li><li><p data-path-to-node=\"4,1,0\">How to register your <b data-path-to-node=\"4,1,0\" data-index-in-node=\"21\">.com</b> domain with Truehost</p></li><li><p data-path-to-node=\"4,2,0\">How to transfer your domain safely</p></li><li><p data-path-to-node=\"4,3,0\">Common registrar errors and how to avoid them</p></li></ul><h3 data-path-to-node=\"6\"><b data-path-to-node=\"6\" data-index-in-node=\"0\"><br></b></h3><h3 data-path-to-node=\"6\"><b data-path-to-node=\"6\" data-index-in-node=\"0\" style=\"font-size: inherit;\">1) Why .COM Still Wears the Crown</b></h3><p data-path-to-node=\"7\">You've probably seen <b data-path-to-node=\"7\" data-index-in-node=\"21\">.co.ke</b>, <b data-path-to-node=\"7\" data-index-in-node=\"29\">.ng</b>, <b data-path-to-node=\"7\" data-index-in-node=\"34\">.in</b>, and even newer ones like <b data-path-to-node=\"7\" data-index-in-node=\"64\">.shop</b>.

Your Website Doesn’t Go Live Immediately After Purchase</b></h4><p data-path-to-node=\"25\">Your domain shows in your dashboard, but your website isn’t loading.
